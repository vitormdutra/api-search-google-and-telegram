This project is a simple implementation of a Telegram bot using Python and Google API Search.

The purpose of this project is to send an image in the Telegram chat whenever the bot is called through the command /search ${anything}, thus leaving the image search generic.

Be careful with what you search for, as there is no filter on what can come from Google search.
